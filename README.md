##Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution (SAGE)

SAGE is a publicly available codebase for modelling galaxy formation in a cosmological context. It is a significant update to that used in [Croton et al. (2006)](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0508046) and has been rebuilt to be modular and customisable. SAGE will run on any N-body simulation whose trees are written in depth-first order and contain a minimum set of basic halo data. 

A description of the model and its default calibration results can be found in [Croton et al. (2015)](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/). Galaxy formation models built using SAGE on the Millennium, Bolshoi and GiggleZ simulations can be downloaded at the [Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory (TAO)](https://tao.asvo.org.au/).
